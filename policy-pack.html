            <h1>Basic Policy Pack</h1>
            <p>The "get out of jail free card" for compliance, insurance, and peace of mind.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="service-detail">
            <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
            <p>Businesses that need formal, written security policies to satisfy external requirements and protect themselves legally:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Growing companies</strong> that have surpassed startup phase and need to formalize operations</li>
                <li><strong>Government contractors or B2B vendors</strong> who must prove compliance to partners</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare, legal, or financial firms</strong> with strict data protection requirements (HIPAA, CCPA, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Businesses applying for cyber insurance</strong> — policies often pay for themselves by securing lower premiums</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What's Included</h2>
            <div class="deliverables">
                <div class="deliverable-item">
                    <h3>1. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</h3>
                    <p>Defines how employees can use company-owned equipment, network resources, and data. Sets clear expectations and reduces risky behavior.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="deliverable-item">
                    <h3>2. Information Security Policy (ISP)</h3>
                    <p>Outlines your overall approach to security, including roles, responsibilities, incident response procedures, and enforcement.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="deliverable-item">
                    <h3>3. Data Breach Response Plan (DBRP)</h3>
                    <p>Step-by-step playbook for what to do if a breach is suspected or occurs. Defines roles, escalation paths, and notification requirements.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="deliverable-item">
                    <h3>4. Employee Acknowledgment Forms</h3>
                    <p>Templates for employees to sign confirming they've read and understood the policies—critical for enforcement and liability protection.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>These policies solve a critical business and legal problem, not just a technical one:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cyber insurance requirements:</strong> Insurance applications increasingly demand proof of formal security policies</li>
                <li><strong>Legal protection:</strong> If you're ever sued or audited, these policies prove you took reasonable steps to protect data</li>
                <li><strong>Vendor compliance:</strong> Many larger companies require vendors to have these policies (SOC 2, ISO 27001 audits)</li>
                <li><strong>Employee clarity:</strong> Sets clear expectations and provides a basis for consistent enforcement</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Process & Timeline</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Policy interview to understand your industry, data types, compliance needs, and current practices</li>
                <li><strong>Days 2-5:</strong> Customization of policy templates specific to your business</li>

            </ol>
            <p><strong>Total timeline:</strong> 7-10 business days from kickoff to final delivery.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>Can we use generic templates from the internet?</h3>
                <p>You could, but they won't be tailored to your specific industry, data types, or compliance needs. Insurance companies and auditors can spot generic templates—customized policies demonstrate real commitment.</p>

                <h3>Do we need to update these policies annually?</h3>
                <p>Yes. We recommend annual reviews to ensure policies reflect current practices, new regulations, and changes in your business operations.</p>

                <h3>What if we already have some policies in place?</h3>
                <p>Great! We can review your existing policies, identify gaps, and provide updates or additions as needed at a reduced scope.</p>
