            <h2>Who We Help</h2>
            <p>We work with small and mid-sized businesses across Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, and India that need affordable, actionable cybersecurity guidance without the enterprise consulting price tag.</p>
            <p>Our clients include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accounting and professional services firms</li>
                <li>Marketing and creative agencies</li>
                <li>Healthcare and dental practices</li>
                <li>Law firms and legal practices</li>
                <li>E-commerce and retail businesses</li>
                <li>Financial advisors and consultancies</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How We're Different</h2>
            <p>Most cybersecurity firms focus on large enterprises with complex compliance requirements. We focus on practical, high-impact security improvements for SMBs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fast delivery:</strong> Most assessments completed in 3-7 days</li>
                <li><strong>Clear language:</strong> No jargon—just actionable advice</li>
                <li><strong>Focused scope:</strong> We solve specific problems, not endless "maturity assessments"</li>
                <li><strong>Affordable pricing:</strong> Fixed-price engagements designed for SMB budgets</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>Every engagement starts with a discovery call to understand your specific pain points. We then recommend the highest-impact service to solve your immediate problem—not a year-long roadmap you'll never execute.</p>
            <p>Our methodology is grounded in industry-standard frameworks like OWASP, NIST, and CISA guidance, adapted for the realities of small business budgets and timelines.</p>

            <h2>Ready to Get Started?</h2>
            <p>Book a free 15-minute discovery call to discuss your security challenges and see if we're a good fit.</p>
