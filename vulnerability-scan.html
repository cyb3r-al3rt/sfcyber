            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>Will the scan disrupt our business operations?</h3>
                <p>Scans are non-intrusive and can be scheduled during off-hours. We configure settings to minimize resource impact on your systems.</p>

                <h3>Do we need permission to scan our own systems?</h3>
                <p>Yes—written authorization is mandatory and included in the consulting agreement. This protects both you and us legally.</p>

                <h3>How often should we run vulnerability scans?</h3>
                <p>We recommend quarterly scans for external-facing systems. New vulnerabilities are discovered constantly, so ongoing monitoring is critical.</p>
