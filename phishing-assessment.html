            <div class="faq">
                <h3>Will my team know this is a test?</h3>
                <p>We recommend telling leadership and IT that a phishing test is coming, but keeping the broader team unaware for accurate results.</p>

                <h3>What if our team performs poorly?</h3>
                <p>That's the point of the assessment. We'll provide clear training and technical recommendations to improve resilience quickly.</p>

                <h3>Do you provide ongoing phishing simulation?</h3>
                <p>Yes, we can set up recurring campaigns on a monthly or quarterly basis as part of an ongoing advisory engagement.</p>
